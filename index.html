What is this page about?
</h2>
<p>
Welcome! I'm launching my own website, and you can help. This is the very early stages of something I hope brings joy, beauty and goodness to the world.
My name is Caelan, but you can call me Cale or "ChiefTruth". For those wondering, I'll share more about my name eventually, but I have many exciting adventures planned for the road ahead.
For now though, I'm working on a project very close to my heart, and this is where I could really use your help! Check out my first project below, and if it interests you, keep checking back
for updates very soon! If this first project doesn't suit you, I do hope you come back as my website grows and thank you for visiting ChiefTruth Projects!

ChiefTruth Running Journey Journal
</h2>

<p>
Thanks for checking out this project; I look forward to learning so much from it and hope it will help me turn this site into something wonderful.
Below, you'll find excerpts from the journal I'm keeping in which I've set up some personal running goals for a 100 day period. This running project
started in early July and will extend through late October. The journal will be fully available in December 2019! I hope you will join me on this
journey, and enjoy learning more about some of my runs such as the "25th Day 25 Miles". Along with all kinds of daily recordings I thought might be relevant
to my running performance, I've also been taking pictures which may be a shot of my routes or just some inspiration for that day. All those pictures, daily recordings,
and more will be made available in the full journal.
